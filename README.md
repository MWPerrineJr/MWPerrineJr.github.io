# Data Science Portfolio for Michael Perrine

### About Me:
Hello my name is Michael Perrine and I have a background in finance where I spent 10 years in planning and advice. I earned my bachelors degree from The Universityof Texas at San Antonio. I am graduating from Bellevue University with a masters degree in data science. This portfolio encompasses the body of work that I've compiled during my 1 1/2 years as a student. My goal is to create a portfolio of realistic use cases to show case my skills as a data scientist. The portfolio is an evolving body of work that will showcase a variety of use cases. I welcome feedback on ways to improve my work. Thank you for viewing my portfolio.

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my wife and four cats. I am originally from Kansas City Mo. and yes a lifelong Chiefs fan. When possible I will disappear to the golf course for a round or two. What I love about data science is the continual evolution of the career and the need to continue to learn and grow my skills. I have an interest in computer vision and deep learning. An area that I plan on spending time after graduation.

### Work/Projects:
This is a summary of the projects contained in the website.
##### Sales Analysis:
- In this section I ran an analysis on synthetic data. The data for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle. The goal of the analysis is to understand the factors that contribute to predicting sales projections. Within the analysis I examined the effects of sales staff, products, and sales figures to project future sales.
##### Fraud Detection:
- In this project I used synthetic data to analyze tranaction data to identify fraudulent transactons. The data for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle. To accompolish this goal I completed a series of transformations. To complete the analysis I built a pipeline and ran a logistic regression. In additon I used the data to build an app to identify a fraudulent transaction.
##### Stock Analysis:
- This analysis focuses on D Wave a quantum computing stock. Understanding stock movement is crucial to making investment decisions. The data is collected from Alpha Vantage a third party site that provides stock data. In the analysis I examined the stock movement over the course of the last four years. In addition I collected the SMA, the lower, middle, and upper bollinger bands. I also calculated the sharp ratio. Finally I ran a random forest regression analysis using XG Boost.
##### Childcare Analysis:
- In this analysis I compared the cost of childcare in the state of Texaa with the cost across the remaining states. In addition I compared the income levels. The goal is to determine where Texas stands regarding childcare costs and income. To accomplish this goal I created subsets of the data to separate Texas from the rest of the states. In the subsets I isolated childcare costs and income. With this data I created illustrations to demonstrate the differences in childcare costs and income.
##### Churn Analysis:
- Customer turnover is a concern for business across many industries. The ability to identify at risk clients before they leave is essential to maintain marketshare. Understanding customer behavior and migration habits thefirm is able to craft programs to promote client retention. This analysis uses a sophisticated artificial neural network to accomplish this goal.
##### Heart Disease Analysis:
- Heart disease is a constant threat to people across the globe. In the US alone heart attacks impact over 800,000 people. What if we could identify those at risk before they face this issue? Through the use of machine learning we can. This analysis uses an artificial neural network to predict those at risk.   
##### LA Crime Analysis:
- Crime threatens all citizens. Understanding crime patterns can help to prevent crime before it happens. This analysis attempts to accomplish this goal. I analyzed LA crime data to understand the areas at most risk of crime. In addition I attempted to find drivers that contribute to criminal activity. Ultimately the end goal is to provide recommendations to help prevent crime and to institute programs to change the tragectory of at risk youth.
##### Pixar Movie Analysis:
- Movies are big business. Everyone loves a great story. One firm that has excelled at story telling is Pixar. Millions of people, young and old, enjoy these stories and spend millions of dollars each year to be entertained. Understanding the keys to Pixar's success is key to gaining market share. This analysis attempts to do just that. I analyzed Pixar's movies to understand which movies earned the most profit and attempted to understand what drives their success.
##### X-Ray Analysis:
- Innovation drives medical advancements. We're seeing more technical advancements happening in the medical field. These advancements are responsible for impovements in quality of life for millions of individuals. One of these advancements is the use of machine learning and AI in medical diagnosis. In this analysis I built a convolutional neural network to identify the differences between heathy and diseased lungs. 
##### Migration Analysis:
- Humans have a rich history of migration. Throughout our history we've always had a propensity to be nomadic. Granted we have been more sedentary in recent times but there is still movement within our societies. Understanding migration patterns albeit minor is crucial for business. Being able to identify areas where people move gives business a competitive edge especially in the construction industry. This analysis attempts to identify migration patterns for that purpose.
