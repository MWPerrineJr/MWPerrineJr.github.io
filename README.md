# Data Science Portfolio for Michael Perrine

### About Me
Hello my name is Michael Perrine and I have a background in finance where I spent 10 years in planning and advice. I earned my bachelors degree from The Universityof Texas at San Antonio. I am graduating from Bellevue University with a masters degree in data science. This portfolio encompasses the body of work that I've compiled during my 1 1/2 years as a student. My goal is to create a portfolio of realistic use cases to show case my skills as a data scientist. The portfolio is an evolving body of work that will showcase a variety of use cases. I welcome feedback on ways to improve my work. Thank you for viewing my portfolio.

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my wife and four cats. I am originally from Kansas City Mo. and yes a lifelong Chiefs fan. When possible I will disappear to the golf course for a round or two. What I love about data science is the continual evolution of the career and the need to continue to learn and grow my skills. I have an interest in computer vision and deep learning. An area that I plan on spending time after graduation.
